SAGA (Statistically Acceptable GAussians) is a test suite proposal for verfying statistical correctness for univariate and multivariate Gaussians. Details and documentation for SAGA will follow on this page, but currently this is in submission for a conference. This research is joint work by James Howe, Thomas Prest, Thomas Ricosset, and MÃ©lissa Rossi.
